            Electric Vehicles are means of transport that consume eclectic energy as fuel instead of traditional fuels such as petrol, diesel, and CNG. These vehicles may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources or maybe inbuilt with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells, or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity.

        Need of Electric Vehicles
      </h2>
      <p class="text-center">
        These are following factors which creates urgent need for use of electric vehicles:<br>
        <ul>

<li>To reduce pollution</li>
<li>To conserve non-renewable natural resources</li>
<li>To promote use of renewable energy</li>
<li>To reduce global warming</li>
<li>To fulfill the need of growing demand of more means of transport</li>
The world population is increasing drastically day by day and the demand of means of transport also growing proportionally. Thus demand of fuel is also increasing.  Too much smoke comes out from traditional vehicles this cause air pollution which take many lives every year. 
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2 class="main-heading ">
        Benefits of Electric Vehicles uses
      </h2>
      <br>
      We all are living in an advance era of technology. Advancement of technology always helps for betterment of human life. Use of electric vehicles are very beneficial for human as well as for environment in many ways. Some of these are given below:
<ul>
  <li>Electric vehicles run from electricity and doesn't emit smoke thus it is very helpful for reducing the pollution which causes many types of life threatening disease.</li>
<li>Petrol, Diesel and CNG are non-renewable natural resources of energy. Over-use of these fuels is not good for nature also. Thus use of electric vehicles can be very helpful for conservation of these natural resources.</li>

<li> Smoke is also one of the major causes of global warming. Thus using electric vehicles will reduce global warming.</li>
<li>Today when advancement of technology growing rapidly electric vehicles are new means of transport to fulfill the larger demand of people growing day by day.</li>
<li>Electric vehicles are eco-friendly. Use of electric vehicles is good for environment as well as human life.</li>
<li>Electric vehicles are new technology. This sector will grow day by day which will generate lot of employment in this field.</li>
<li>Electric vehicle will reduce the dependency of a nation on petroleum export countries.</li>
<li>This will reduce the import cost of petrol, diesel like fuels and thus it will help in growing the economy of the country.</li>
<li>Cost of electric vehicles is also low if we compare the recurring expenditure on petrol and diesel used in traditional means of transport.
</li>
</ul>

        Advantages of using electronic vehicles
      </h2>
      <p class="text-center">
        The fact that the electric car was becoming a success in the late 1990 is not a big surprise. People again experienced the advantages of an electric car. People realized they saved lots of money on their fuel costs and produced much less pollution by driving electric cars. They found it an encouraging thought that they contributed to a better climate while they were saving money as well.

Contributing to a better climate is now one of the most important concerns in the world. We canâ€™t avoid the fact that the climate is changing. Therefore we need to look for alternatives to fight these environmental problems like air pollution and global warming.

One of the best alternatives is replacing the old combustion engine vehicles with electric cars. Electric cars produce zero emissions, so they donâ€™t contribute to air pollution at all. Besides air pollution, they also make no sound, so they donâ€™t contribute to noise pollution either.

Unlike the fuel powered cars, the electric cars have got fewer moving parts. The technical construction of the electric car is much simpler and much more efficient. That makes the electric car more reliable and easier in maintenance.

All the electricity is stored in high-end batteries. These car batteries are used to have a lifespan of 5 years. These rechargeable batteries are fully recyclable, this keeps the old batteries of becoming a disposal problem. It also makes the electric car more durable en cheaper the longer term.

The last few years the prices of oil has risen sharply. Oil is the black gold, but the prices of oil are so high for a reason. Oil is one of the fossil fuels and these fossil fuels are limited. Oil is getting scarcer every day, and youâ€™ll pay the price.

Electricity is not a fossil fuel and therefore not limited. This makes electricity much cheaper than fuel. One of the biggest advantages of driving an electric car are the fuel costs.

For example: When you are driving 40 miles a day in an electrically powered car which has got a mileage of 280 watts per hour per mile and a electricity price of $0.10 kilowatts per hour, it would cost you $1.12.

When you are driving the same 40 miles in an fuel powered car with a mileage of 25 miles per gallon you would need 1.6 gallons of fuel. 1.6 gallons of fuel at a price of $3 per gallon would cost you $4.80.

In this case, driving your fuel powered car is 4 times more expensive than travelling the same miles in an electric car. 

In fact, traveling in your electric car can even be cheaper. Here is another example of saving more money on your fuel costs. Recharging your electric car during the nighttimes when the electricity is cheaper will save you even more money.

        Disadvantages of using electronic vehicles
      </h2>
      <p class="text-center">
        Earlier on we explained that driving an electric car has many technical, environmental and financial advantages. How come that not everyone has exchanged his regular fueled car for an electric car?

        Well, unfortunately there are still some disadvantages about driving and purchasing an electric car.
        
        One of the biggest disadvantages is that the electric car is in a high-dollar prototype stage. Car producing companies have to do many research and many tests to find a way to develop these electric cars. The electric cars also have to meet the safety requirements, just like the regular cars. This requires even more research and more investments from the car companies. To makes these investments attractive for the car producing companies, the government provides subsidies. With providing these subsidies, the cost of an electric car will lower and purchasing one will become accessible for everyone soon.
        
        Besides the purchase of an electric car, there are also some disadvantages in its use.
        
        One of the reasons the combustion engine won the competition a few decades ago, was that it would only take a few minutes to refill your car with gasoline. Refilling an electric car took half a day.
        
        Still, refilling â€“ or recharging â€“ your electric car is one of the disadvantages. It takes 3 to 10 hours to fully recharge a car battery. So when you are running out of fuel, you wonâ€™t be able to quickly recharge your battery. The only solution is to charge your car battery overnight, just like the way you would recharge your mp3-player.
      <br>
      <h2 class="main-heading ">
        Government initiative towards use of Electric Vehicles
      </h2>
      <br>
      As electric vehicle is cheaper in long run and also environment friendly, Government is continuously promoting the use of electric vehicles. Since long time many trains including metros have been running on electricity. Indian Railways trains are now almost running on electricity. Electric bike, electronic car, electronic rikshaw are already in market. Now people should use more electric vehicles in place of traditional petrol & diesel vehicles. Government has started campaign to promote use of electric vehicles. Some rebate on taxes and subsidy on purchasing the electric vehicles, are also provided by the Government. Recently Delhi Government has launched 'Switch Delhi' campaign to promote the use of electric vehicles.
